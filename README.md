# wordle-game
## Description
This is a clone of the popular **Wordle** game, where you have to guess the five-letter word in six attempts or less.

This application was written in **TypeScript** and stylized with **SASS**.

When an user submits a word it makes a request to the [**Free Dictionary API**](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to ensure it exists.

This application was made to be showcased in my [Software Developer portfolio](https://carlos-quintana.github.io/).

### How to play
The rules of the game are simple:
- You have to guess the word in six attempts or less.
- The word has to exists (in the English language).
- If the letter is correct, the color would turn green.
- If the letter is correct but placed wrong then it would turn yellow.
- If the letter is incorrect it turns gray.
- Letters can be used more than one time.

**Warning**: *If your browser or OS forces dark mode on webpages this site might look different. For best user experience we recommend you turn that setting off.*
